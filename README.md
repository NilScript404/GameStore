# GameStore App

this is GameStore app written with C , using Raylib and Raygui.
its going to handle basic funcionality of a game store app , the user will be capable of adding games , removing games , selling games , also keeping track of the game that have been sold and other information regarding sales.

its going to have an interactive user intertface , capable of doing what the average app does , and even more complicated things.
this is done as a hobby , because i wanted to explore raylib and raygui using C and learning mroe about C itself.
